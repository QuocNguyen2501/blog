# Blog

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.2 with Server Side Redering.

It is used like a place where I collect my posts from Medium platform and it is also a place for me to play with Angular SSR, Docker, Docker-compose and Azure platform.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.


## Deployment
This is a preliminary plan, as it depends on my budget. If I don't have sufficient funds to keep the page online continuously, I will write an article on Medium explaining how to implement the following process.
