# Blog

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.2 with Server Side Redering.

It is used like a place where I collect my posts from Medium platform and it is also a place for me to play with Angular SSR, Docker, Docker-compose and Azure platform.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
